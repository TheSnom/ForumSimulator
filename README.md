# Instructions
In order to use this program you can either download the program(which I have not tested as most of this has been developed on mobile), or you can copy the code and go to any python online compiler and run the progam there. 
To use you will need to type in 2 numbers. The first one is The precentage that the likes are multiplied by. Then hit enter. Then type in the number that the dislikes are multipleid by, hitting enter once again. Then you can copy in any /post commands (not profile posts yet sorry) an it will automaticly spit out the result text for you.
